# /ygg.drift

## Workflow

1. Run `ygg drift`.

2. For each node with drift:
   - Show which file changed and a summary of what changed
   - Ask the user: \"Absorb (update graph to match code) or
     Reject (rematerialize from graph)?\"

3. For \"Absorb\": help the user update the relevant artifacts in .yggdrasil/
   to reflect the code change.

4. For \"Reject\": add the node to the rematerialization list and
   offer to run /ygg.materialize.

## Rules

- Always show the drift before asking for a decision.
- Do not automatically resolve drift. The user decides.
