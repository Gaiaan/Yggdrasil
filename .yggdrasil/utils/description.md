# Utilities

Small, focused utility functions used across the codebase. No dependencies on other project modules — these are leaf helpers.

|---------|---------|
| hash | SHA-256 file and string hashing |
| tokens | Token count estimation (js-tiktoken) |
| paths | Path resolution and normalization |
